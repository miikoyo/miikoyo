### Hi, I'm Mikoyo!
- Complete beginner when it comes to programming, but I'm hoping to familiarize myself with Lua and maybe learn a bit of Haxe.
  - <sub>*Why yes, I like Friday Night Funkin', how could you tell?*</sub>
- Outside of Friday Night Funkin' modding, I'd like to use my experience with Lua for work on personal projects, and to maybe even try my hand at GameMaker, but that's a horizon too distant to properly consider as of now.
- If you ever want to reach me (for any reason), you can do so at ***mikoyo#5060*** over on Discord!
